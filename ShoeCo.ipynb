To produce a pair of shoes, 4 hours of labor and \\\\$15 of raw materials are required. ShoeCo must meet demand every month and must pay \\\\$3 for every pair of shoes in inventory at the end of each month.

To fix it, we could just \"round up\" in this case to get an apprximate solution.  More generally, we should declare/constrain these decision variables to take only integer values.  But this will wait for the integer programming section of the course.\n"
