    "# Jedi Robes, Inc -- Basic Logical Constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "Production planning problems involve making decisions about how of several different products to make. Suppose Jedi Robes, Inc., top producer of robes for the Jedi Council, expands to producing 5 clothing items by using two different production processes: weaving and infusing. Each clothing item requires a number of hours to produce and contributes a fixed number of credits to JRIâ€™s profit. Each unit of each product requires 20 hours of labor for final assembly. The production factory has 3 weaving machines and 2 infusion tanks. The facility runs 6 days a week with 2 shifts each day (8 hours/shift). Eight employees work in assembly, each working one shift/day. Figure out how many items to produce each week.\n",
