    "# Putting Jedi Masters in the Training Rooms - A QAP Example\n",

    "The Jedi Temple on Dantooine is building 4 training rooms  (1, 2, 3, 4) for Padawans. There is a walking distance (in feet) between all pairs of rooms ($d_{ij}$) Jedi Masters (Asnar, Bendak, Chorla, Duzek) need to be assigned to one of the 4 rooms. Make assignment so Padawans travelling between rooms don’t need to walk too far. We know how many Padawans will need to travel between each pair of Jedi Masters ($f_{ij}$).\n"
