    "In a GAP model, we have a set of “machines” M = {1,2,…,m} and a set of “jobs” N = {1,2,…,n} that must be assigned to machines. Each machine i has a capacity $b_i$ units of work. Each job j requires $a_{ij}$ units of work to be completed if it is scheduled on machine i. All jobs must be assigned to exactly one machine. There is a fixed cost $h_i$ of using machine i."

    "It is pretty clear that the third case solves the fastest. This becomes even more obvious for larger instances. Why does this happen? It's all about the convex hull! Because of how we make use of other information in the model in case 3, the LP relaxation of case 3 is the closest to the convex hull of the IP feasible set. The closer to the convex hull we get, the better. The solver works by solving a relaxed version of the model and \"closing the gap\" between the LP solution and the optimal IP solution. Closer to convex hull = smaller gap to close."
