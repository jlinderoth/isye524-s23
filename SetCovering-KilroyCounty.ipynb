    "# Kilroy County Fire Stations - A Set Covering Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Kilroy County has 6 cities. The county must determine where to build fire stations to serve these cities. They want to build the stations in some of the cities, and to build the minimum number of stations needed to ensure that at least one station is within 15 minutes driving time of each city. Can we formulate an integer program whose solution gives the minimum number of re stations and their locations?\n",
