    "A mother needs to assign each of her 5 children to 5 different sandwiches. Each child has given a preference for each sandwich by rating it from 0 to 10 (0 indicates strong dislike and 10 indicates strong preference). The mother wishes to assign sandwiches in such a way as to maximize the overall satisfaction. The preferences of the children are as follows:\n",
